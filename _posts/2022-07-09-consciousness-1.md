*This post will be the first of many that clarifies how I currently think about consciousness — what it is, why it’s important, and how to study it scientifically.*

As there are different uses of the word “consciousness”, I should start by stating that the definition that interests me most is what philosophers might call “phenomenal consciousness”. This was to differentiate it from other uses, for example, the commonsense equating of consciousness with wakefulness. Under the consciousness-as-wakefulness definition, you can be said to lose consciousness when you sleep, and regain it when you wake. But phenomenal consciousness can be pointed out by the fact that during sleep, we’re conscious of sights, sounds, and sensations when we dream [1]. 

One useful tool to start illuminating questions of consciousness is to imagine a functional duplicate of yourself — that is, an identical clone in all regards but one; the clone lacks an inner life. This clone would drive a car, go to work, and talk with your friends, but there would be nothing *that it is like* to be that being (Nagel 1974). They would yell out if stabbed, but wouldn’t actually feel any pain, and would even say they were conscious if asked. Whether or not it’s possible for this clone to exist given the rules of our universe is unknown, but the fact that philosophical zombies, as they are called, are conceptually possible, raises the question of how physical things (e.g. neurons, electrical impulses, etc.) relate to conscious things (e.g. the feeling of seeing red) [2].

In addition to illuminating the Hard Problem (Chalmers 1995), a variant of this zombie thought experiment elucidates why the fact of subjective experience is so personally compelling to me. In his book “Being You”, Anil Seth puts it like this:

> Imagine that a future version of me, perhaps not so far away, offers you the deal of a lifetime. I can replace your brain with a machine that is its equal in every way, so that from the outside, nobody could tell the difference. This new machine has advantages—it is immune to decay, and perhaps it will allow you to live forever. But there’s a catch. Since even future-me is not sure how real brains give rise to consciousness, I can’t guarantee that you will have any conscious experiences at all, should you take up this offer.

The hesitation that we feel from taking the offer in the Ghost in The Shell thought experiment clearly tells to me that consciousness is the basis for anything *mattering* [3]
