In 1990, Francis Crick (of double helix fame) and Christof Koch (dog lover and current director of the Allen Institute for Brain Science) set off the search for the holy grail of consciousness neuroscience; the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs). Whoever got there first would retain everlasting glory in the hallowed pages of Nature and be first in line for eternal existence via mind upload.

Okay, so the second part I’m not so sure, but it does seem like something worth spending a lifetime seeking. More on that later — let’s clarify what exactly an NCC is.

The first thing to note is that calling the grail the neural “correlate” seems on its face a bit flaccid. Mere correlation is not usually the ultimate object of desire, scientific or otherwise. And as we all know from Statistics 101, ice cream sales correlate with shark attacks, but this statistical observation says nothing about whether ice cream sales *cause* shark attacks - maybe it’s the other way around, or maybe both are caused by a third variable [1]. And of course, it also doesn’t speak to whether one is necessary or sufficient for the other.

That being said, “correlates” was likely adopted for its theoretical neutrality and consequent palatability. While the term “NCC” has remained unchanged since its inception, the current agreed-upon definition has been refined over the years, like any good menu item. 

The current recipe: an NCC is the “**minimal** set of neural events jointly **sufficient** for a specific conscious experience (given the appropriate enabling conditions)” (Koch 2004: 97). 

So why must the criteria be neural events that are “sufficient”, instead of “necessary”, or “necessary and sufficient”? Happily, by discussing why not “necessary” [2], we can feed two birds with one scone (or two bois with one bone), because the following line of reasoning rules out the “necessary and sufficient” as well. The problem is this -- we don't know beforehand whether it's possible for a single conscious experience, e.g. the taste of a good scone, to be supported by **redundant neural events** (i.e multiple brain processes redundantly giving rise to a single consicous experience). If this is the case, such that each event can independently result in the conscious taste of the aforementioned scone, disrupting one process but sparing the other(s) will not lead to disruption of this gustatory experience. Therefore, you can’t call that individual neural events “necessary”, even though it’s perfectly reasonable to think of it as an NCC [3].

> Two birds with one scone, or two bois with one bone, the moral is the same. Removing one won’t result in food left uneaten.

And why minimally sufficient, instead of just sufficient? Without the modifer, there is an unbounded definition. It allows for something like the entire brain to be considered an NCC… and the entire brain minus 1 neuron, and the entire brain minus 2 neurons, and so forth, until we actually get to disrupting the conscious experience in question. The logical conclusion is that we should shave off as much excess neural activity/regions/events as possible, so minimal sufficiency is the criteria that we land on.

Historically, the start of the NCC search in the 90s coincided with advances in neuroimaging and recording technology, as well as the entrance of Nobel prize scientists, like Francis Crick and Gerald Edelman, into the fray. The subsequent flood of research has established the NCC project as a robust space for inquiry and helped to legitimize consciousness science as a whole. 

To zoom out briefly — the universe’s greatest mysteries present themselves in triune: the mystery of existence (something from nothing), life (living from non-living), and consciousness (conscious from unconscious)[4]. Oftentimes, the weight of their sheer significance can have a stupefying effect, and additionally for consciousness, lead to endless philosophical debates. 

However, programs like the search for the neural correlates of consciousness helps to contexualize the role that philosophical debate and the feeling of significance and should play instead, which is that of navigation and fuel for the journey, respectively. The NCC project provides us a vehicle to get *there*.

[1] this is known as the principle of common cause (Reichenbach 1956) 

[2] The simple test for whether something is necessary: ‘if not X, then not Y’.

[3] The logic of this argument may apply if neuroplasticity is quick enough as well — if another neural process or region can take over for a disrupted target region in supporting a single conscious experience, we can’t technically say that the target region is *necessary* for that conscious experience.

[4] A certain flavor of panpsychism would of course reject the premise of unconscious things giving rise to conscious things
